2. **Navigate Floors**: Scroll through floors to see all rooms
3. **Select Room**: Click any room tile to open detailed modal
4. **Update Status**: Use status buttons or quick actions in the modal
5. **Monitor Changes**: Watch live updates in status counters

### Housekeeping Operations
1. **View Tasks**: Switch to "Housekeeping" tab
2. **Start Task**: Click "Start Task" for pending items
3. **Complete Work**: Mark tasks as complete when finished
4. **Monitor Staff**: Check team status panel for staff activities

### Maintenance Management
1. **Review Issues**: Switch to "Maintenance" tab
2. **Prioritize Work**: Urgent items highlighted with red indicators
3. **Track Progress**: Monitor technician assignments and progress
4. **Update Status**: Start work and mark completion

### Reports & Analytics
1. **Performance Metrics**: Switch to "Reports" tab
2. **Review Statistics**: Check completion rates and averages
3. **Identify Trends**: Use data for operational improvements

## Configuration

### Status Colors
The color scheme can be customized in the `roomStatuses` state object:
- Green: Vacant Clean (#10B981)
- Red: Occupied (#EF4444)
- Yellow: Vacant Dirty (#F59E0B)
- Orange: Out of Order (#F97316)
- Blue: Being Cleaned (#3B82F6)

### Grid Layout
Room grid layout uses Tailwind CSS custom grid classes:
- 8 columns on mobile
- 12 columns on medium screens
- 15 columns on large screens

These can be adjusted in `tailwind.config.js`.

## Integration Notes

### API Endpoints
The module expects these API endpoints:
- `GET /api/rooms/status-summary` - Room status counts
- `GET /api/rooms/map` - Floor map with room details
- `GET /api/housekeeping/tasks` - Housekeeping task list
- `GET /api/maintenance/tasks` - Maintenance request list
- `PUT /api/rooms/{id}/status` - Update room status (to be implemented)

### Mock Data Fallback
When API endpoints are unavailable, the system uses comprehensive mock data to ensure full functionality during development and demonstrations.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live status changes
2. **Photo Gallery**: Room photos and before/after cleaning images
3. **Guest Integration**: Direct link to guest profile and reservation system
4. **Automated Scheduling**: AI-powered task scheduling optimization
5. **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile interface for housekeeping staff
